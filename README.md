# [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) - Auto

Steam Achievement Manager (SAM) is a lightweight, portable application used to manage achievements and statistics in the popular PC gaming platform Steam. This application requires the [Steam client](https://store.steampowered.com/about/), a Steam account and network access. Steam must be running and the user must be logged in.

## What does Auto mean?

There is a pull request that added unlock all available achievements feature to SAM https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager/pull/62

I just copied those codes and merged them to original SAM.

Actually I have no idea what I am doing but somehow it works.
